# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis of AirBnb Bookings

The aim of this project was to perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb booking data to identify key trends and patterns that would help improve the business. The data consisted of various features such as location, price, number of reviews, property type, room type, and others, and it was collected over a specified period of time. The goal of the EDA was to clean and preprocess the data, conduct statistical and visual analysis, and finally draw conclusions and make recommendations based on the findings.
The first step in the EDA process was to clean and preprocess the data. This involved handling missing values, removing outliers, and transforming variables where necessary. The cleaning process was important because it ensured that the data was consistent and ready for analysis.
Next, univariate analysis was performed to get a general understanding of the individual features in the data. This involved summarizing each feature using measures such as mean, median and visualizing the data using histograms and box plots. The results showed that the data was heavily skewed and had outliers, which needed to be removed for accurate analysis.
Bivariate analysis was performed to understand the relationship between two variables. This involved plotting scatter plots, calculating correlation coefficients, and performing hypothesis testing. The results showed that there were strong relationships between the price, location, and number of reviews and the demand for Airbnb bookings.
Segmentation was also performed to understand the preferences of different segments of customers. This involved dividing the data into smaller groups based on variables such as location, property type, and room type. The results showed that different segments of customers had different preferences and that these preferences were largely driven by the price and location.
The insights gathered from the EDA were then used to make recommendations for Airbnb. Some of the recommendations included improving the pricing strategies, increasing the number of reviews, and providing a more user-friendly experience. These recommendations were aimed at increasing the demand for Airbnb bookings and improving the overall customer experience.
In conclusion, the exploratory data analysis of Airbnb booking data provided valuable insights into the trends and patterns in the data. The results showed that location, price, and number of reviews were the most important factors affecting Airbnb bookings and that different segments of customers had different preferences. The findings from the EDA can be used by Airbnb to improve their services and better cater to the needs of their customers. The results of the EDA demonstrate the importance of data analysis in decision-making and provide a foundation for further research and analysis.
